# About Theme

This theme is a custom theme based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io).

Please first understand the usage of [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/).

If you like my theme, please give me one <a href="https://github.com/MaLuns/hexo-theme-async" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MaLuns/hexo-theme-async?style=social" alt="GitHub stars" style="display: inline-block;"></a> Encourage me.

> Because I use [SATA License](https://github.com/zTrix/sata-license). Lol. You don't know what this means? Simply put, if you use the theme, you need to click on a Star, and then you can use it wherever you want.

## Keywords

Simple, elegant, adaptive and beautiful.
